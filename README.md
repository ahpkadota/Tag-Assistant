#   The ByteCounter Chrome Extension is a tool that adds a small form to TCS to:
#    1. Record all the cases reviewed on TCS.
#    2. Annotate the cases according to its difficulty and the potential issues encountered.
#  The information recorded includes: Timestamp, Queue ID, Object ID, Policy Tags Applied, Difficulty (on a scale of 1 to 5) and Cluster (for example, "Minor Sexualized Framing" --> "low angle").
#  This data is compiled in the extension, and can be downloaded in a ".csv" file so it can be easily viewed in a spreadsheets editor such as Feishu Sheets or Excel.
