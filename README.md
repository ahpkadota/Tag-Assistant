#   Tag Assistant Chrome Extension
The Tag Assistant Chrome Extension is a tool that displays a warning messages when certain policy titles are tagged in TCS: 

    1 - Displays a red message when two incompatible titles are multitagged
    2 - Displays an orange message when two titles who are often not multitagged are tagged
    3 - Displays a green message when a title is tagged, with often multitagged suggestions
    
The information about the titles are available in: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n_AvbdwOG5mwPhToslxcQr7fxCa5bfVUeDEjIfIxW1U/edit?pli=1#gid=751223416
These should be loaded in the "options" menu of the extension. 
The options menu features a grid in which the pair of policy titles can be selected, so that when the pair is tagged simultaneously, a corresponding popup warning will appear. 

### SUGGESTED CHANGES
    1 - Move from "grid view" to "select form"
    2 - Display status of current tasks, and display multitagging information based on the titles applied.
    3 - Add "!" warning badge when any of the cases have incompatible titles tagged
    4 - Add "GA" option, so that an alert is displayed when trying to submit a form with one or more cases with no tags applied.
